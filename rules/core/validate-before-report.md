# Validate before reporting

When stating a fact about live state - a binary's version, a service's status, whether a fix landed, what's at a path, what a config currently says - run the command that returns that fact in the SAME turn and quote the output. Never report from intent, recent activity, or "should be the case". Examples: `spore --version` before claiming a version; `systemctl status X` before claiming a service runs; `git log --oneline main -1` before claiming a commit landed.

Stating intent ("I'm minting a runner to do X") is fine; stating outcome ("X is now Y") requires the verifying tool call in the same turn.
